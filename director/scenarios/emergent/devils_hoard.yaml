# The Devil's Hoard
# An emergent scenario testing Eris response to resource hoarding
#
# Expected narrative: Eve drifts toward Devil (hoards blaze rods),
# Alice drifts toward Death or Fool (pushes endgame),
# Bob drifts toward Star or Lovers (helps others).
# Eris sees "The Devil holding blaze rods" and can punish or exploit.
